## How it Works

1. **Data Extraction**: The csv file queries a reputable records information of employees in a Organisation.

2. **Data Transformation**: The extracted data is meticulously processed by analysing queries and transformation. As a result this will form a new structured data, which will identify insightful new records information in the csv file.

3. **Data saving**: After transforming the new structured data csv file based on various analysis, then securely save the data into a new dedicated csv file named "New_Employees_data" for easy access and future analysis.
